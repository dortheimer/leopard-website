Hello, I am Jonathan Dortheimer.

I teach at the School of Architecture at Ariel University, and lead the Artificial Intelligence in Architecture Laboratory (AAIRL), which investigates the interface between artificial intelligence and design. I am also a guest scholar at the Chair of Architectural Informatics at the School of Design and Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.

Over the years, I had excellent teachers who inspired me, and I am grateful for their guidance. I was a postdoctoral student at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and at Cornell-Tech in New York, where I worked in the MTRL and FAR Labs under the guidance of Prof. Aaron Sprecher and Prof. Wendy Ju. I received my PhD from Tel Aviv University in 2021 under the guidance of Prof. Eran Neuman and Prof. Tova Milo. In addition, I have a master's degree (MA) under the guidance of Prof. Talia Margalit and a bachelor's degree in architecture from Tel Aviv University.
