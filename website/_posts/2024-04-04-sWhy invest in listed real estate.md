Why invest in listed real estate and not into private equity/club deals?

* Liquidity: Shares offer greater liquidity than properties, allowing for easier leverage adjustments and shifts in asset allocation

* Lower Transaction Costs: Listed real estate transactions typically incur lower costs compared to private equity deals

* Improved Corporate Governance: Publicly listed real estate companies often exhibit better corporate governance practices compared to private equity structures

* Historical Performance: Research indicates that REITs have outperformed private equity real estate by 5.9% annually in the US 

* Access to Properties at Appealing Valuations: Investing in listed companies can provide exposure to properties not available for sale, potentially at more attractive implied valuations

### Why now? 

Between January 2022 and March 2024, significant fluctuations in government bond yields led to a repricing of real estate financing rates. This caused a 31% drop in the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Europe Index, presenting an opportunity to acquire listed real estate targets at discounted prices. This environment is particularly favorable for companies that:

 * Trade at high rental yields, providing a healthy spread over financing costs

* Have leases indexed to support rental growth and future valuations

* Locked in fixed-interest debt with longer maturities

* Possess assets in high demand in private markets
