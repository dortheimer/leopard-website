<p>I find that starting with related parties is often the most effective approach. Begin by examining the company’s early financial statements. In the initial listing periods, companies tend to be smaller, and individual transactions are more significant. These early financials often provide more detailed disclosures compared to later periods, where transactions may be considered non-material. Take notes on all related parties, and keep this list for future reference, as names tend to reappear in later periods. Additionally, searching online for lawsuits and news involving these early-day related parties can provide valuable context. For instance, one company I researched, provided a loan to its controlling shareholder to invest alongside the company in a certain asset. The loan accrued interest at a significantly low rate and remained on the books for years. This posed a risk to minority shareholders, as they effectively financed the controlling shareholder’s equity investment without real collateral. Despite assurances from investor relations that the loan would be repaid by year-end, it remains outstanding, with its value at one point exceeding the company’s whole market cap. The company’s shares fell by 85% since the IR call, highlighting the potential pitfalls of such transactions and providing insight into the character of executives who allow such practices. Another example of related-party red flags involves a company that acquired a majority stake in a low-leverage company, using the target’s balance sheet to borrow additional funds. These funds were then diverted to the controlling shareholder via upstream loans and downstream asset sales. Questions to IR were brushed away, and shares dropped more than 40% since, while the relevant benchmark rose by 15%.</p>

<p>Next, examine the executive compensation section to understand how it is structured. Ensure that compensation is tied to the company’s real value drivers rather than the share price, which can be manipulated through buybacks, or to accounting figures that can be manipulated by executives (e.g., NAV, non-cash items, etc). For example, one company that spent heavily on share buybacks had 40% of its executive compensation tied to stock price growth. While buy-backs are generally seen as positive, they should not be used to game the executive paycheck. There is no real value created by a buy-back.</p>

<p>Pull financial statements of related parties from the company register, where available. This can confirm how related parties describe transactions with the target company and reveal undisclosed beneficial owners, transaction details, or original property costs. In real estate transactions, assets are sometimes sold in share deals. Even if the land register is not public, ownership can be tracked via company registers if the holding company’s name is available. Analyzing these can reveal seller involvement in the acquiring entity or financing it with equity or debt. This might serve either to demonstrate to the market/valuator that the selling entity can sell assets at a certain price or to strip assets from the company at a low price. Some of these investments into the acquiring party by the researched company might pass as “Non-Material” and show up as an “Other Asset” with no disclosure, while a public register might provide information about the acquiring entity and its investors/financiers.</p>

<p>Create a spreadsheet detailing the acquisition and sale of specific assets to determine if the company has a history of profitable transaction cycles of buying and selling properties at a profit, or if it is like many REITs that buy income only to sell assets at a loss when leases end. Verify and compare actual results to the company and analysts’ narrative. For example, a company might claim to sell a property above book value, but without knowing the historical cost, it’s hard to assess management’s asset management skills.</p>

<p>Cash is king for yielding properties. To get a better understanding of a company’s performance, it’s useful to create an adjusted balance sheet and P&amp;L, adjusting for valuation gains to determine the cash yield.  For example, one company I researched was touted by sell-side analysts as able to acquire low-yielding assets and rapidly transform them into high-yielding properties. However, due to the company’s frequent acquisitions and booking of valuation gains, verifying this claim proved challenging. It was only by constructing a cash-based portfolio value and comparing it with the actual cash flow that the true situation became clear - the sell-side narrative was not supported by cash income.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ophir Dortheimer</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When deciding to spend time researching a real estate company, it is useful to start with red flags.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Leopard Asset Management Urges Sun Corporation’s Shareholders to Hold Management Accountable for Their Failure to Achieve Their Own Stated Goals of Increasing Shareholder Value</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/07/10/sun-corporation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Leopard Asset Management Urges Sun Corporation’s Shareholders to Hold Management Accountable for Their Failure to Achieve Their Own Stated Goals of Increasing Shareholder Value" /><published>2024-07-10T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2024-07-10T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/07/10/sun-corporation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2024/07/10/sun-corporation.html"><![CDATA[<p>Leopard Asset Management Ltd. (“LAM”) advises various longstanding minority shareholders in Sun Corporation (stock code: 6736 JP). LAM urges Sun’s shareholders to hold management accountable for their failure to achieve their own stated goals of increasing shareholder value. On June 25, vote against Ryusuke Utsumi, CEO and his management team.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.valueforsun.com/undervaluation">Since we raised concerns</a> about the undervaluation of Sun in March 2024 and <a href="https://www.valueforsun.com/analysing-sun-s-response">debunked Sun’s management push-back</a> on our suggestion to distribute the shares of Cellebrite (NASDAQ:CLBT US) as a dividend to shareholders, fellow shareholders have reached out and expressed their frustration with management.</p>

<p>Sun’s value is derived from cash and securities holding, 47% holdings in Cellebrite and its entertainment and IT business. We believe, the fair value for Sun’s shares based on its liquid assets alone is in excess of ¥7,200, after accounting for deferred taxes. This compares to the current market price of ¥3,300. Based on the (lack of) actions of Sun’s management up to now, we believe they are not genuinely interested in closing this gap.</p>

<p>Between the launch of LAM’s campaign in March and management’s release of the upcoming AGM agenda, Sun’s share price appreciated by 23%, reaching an all-time high of ¥4,250 and adding approximately ¥19 billion to its market capitalization. During this period, the average daily trading volume increased by 160% compared to early 2024, exceeding an average of 80,000 shares per day. This surge reflects investors’ belief that management would address Sun’s share price undervaluation. However, after the company published a “no-news” agenda for the June AGM, the share price plummeted by 19%, wiping out approximately ¥17 billion in shareholder value in three days. We believe this decline highlights shareholders’ lack of trust in Sun’s management will to resolve this undervaluation.</p>

<p>Sun’s management stated in November 2021 that it is “considering all possible measures to improve this situation [undervaluation]”. Then again, in reply to our engagement, management wrote in February 2024 ”We are considering various measures to enhance the SUN’s shareholder value (…)”.</p>

<p>We believe management has had ample time to drive change and realize the value of the company’s assets. Shareholders must hold management accountable by exercising their rights and decide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>has this management been openly communicating its plan for the company and for its holding in Cellebrite, which accounts for more than double the market value of Sun?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have they made any genuine effort to resolve this undervaluation?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do they have any actionable plan for the liquid assets which comprise more than 70% of the balance sheet?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are they the best leadership to grow Sun’s entertainment and IT business?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We call on shareholders to hold the board accountable for their lack of action and entrenchment.</p>
